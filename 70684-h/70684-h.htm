</div>

<p class='c012'>No one who ever saw Henrik Ibsen, in his later
years at any rate, could doubt that he was a born
aristocrat. It is said that a change came over his
appearance and manner after the publication of <cite>Brand</cite>—that
he then put off the Bohemian and put on the
reserved, correct, punctilious man-of-the-world. When
I first saw him in 1881, he had the air of a polished
statesman or diplomatist. Distinction was the note of
his personality. So early as 1872, he had written to
George Brandes, who was then involved in one of his
many controversies, “Be dignified! Dignity is the
only weapon against such assaults.” His actual words,
<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Vær Fornem!</cite></span> mean, literally translated, “Be distinguished!”
No democratic movement which implied
a levelling down, could ever command Ibsen’s sympathy.
He was a leveller up, or nothing.</p>

<p class='c001'>This deep-rooted trait in his character found its
supreme expression in <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of his first remarks (to Brandes, January 3,
1882) after the storm had broken out over <cite>Ghosts</cite> was:
“I feel most painfully affected by the crudity, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>plebeian element in all our public discussion. The
very praiseworthy attempt to make of our people a
democratic community has inadvertently gone a good
way towards making us a plebeian community. Distinction
of soul seems to be on the decline at home.”
The same trend of thought makes itself felt again
and again in Dr. Stockmann’s great speech in the
fourth act of <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>; but it appears
only incidentally in that play, and not at all in <cite>The
Wild Duck</cite>. It was a visit which he paid to Norway
in the summer of 1885 that brought the need for
“ennoblement” of character into the foreground of
his thought, and inspired him with the idea of <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>.
“Since he had last been home,” writes
Henrik Jæger, “the great political battle had been
fought out, and had left behind it a fanaticism and
bitterness of spirit which astounded him. He was
struck by the brutality of the prevailing tone; he felt
himself painfully affected by the rancorous and vulgar
personalities which drowned all rational discussion of
the principles at stake; and he observed with sorrow
the many enmities to which the contest had given rise....
On the whole, he received the impression—as he
remarked in conversation—that Norway was inhabited,
not by two million human beings, but by two million
cats and dogs. This impression has recorded itself in
the picture of party divisions presented in <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>.
The bitterness of the vanquished is admirably
embodied in Rector Kroll; while the victors’ craven
reluctance to speak out their whole hearts is excellently
characterised in the freethinker and opportunist,
Mortensgård.”</p>

<p class='c001'>What was this “great political battle,” the echoes
of which reverberate through <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>? Though
a knowledge of its details is in no way essential to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>the comprehension of the play, the following account<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
of it may not be out of place.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Norwegian constitution of 1814 gave the King
of Norway and Sweden a suspensive veto on the
enactments of the Norwegian Storthing or Parliament,
but provided that a bill passed by three successive
triennial Storthings should become law without
the Royal assent. This arrangement worked well
enough until about 1870, when the Liberal party
became alive to a flaw in the Constitution. The whole
legislative and financial power was vested in the
Storthing; but the Ministers had no seats in it and
acknowledged no responsibility save to the King.
Thus the overwhelming Liberal majority in the
Storthing found itself baulked at every turn by a
Conservative ministry, over which it had no effective
control. In 1872, a Bill enacting that Ministers
should sit in the Storthing was passed by 80 votes to
29, and was vetoed by the King. It was passed again
and again by successive Storthings, the last time by
93 votes to 20; but now King Oscar came forward
with a declaration that <em>on matters affecting the Constitution</em>
his veto was not suspensive, but absolute, and
once more vetoed the Bill. This measure was met by
the Storthing with a resolution (June 9, 1880) that the
Act had become law in spite of the veto. The King
ignored the resolution, and, by the advice of his
Ministers, claimed an absolute veto, not only on constitutional
questions, but on measures of supply. Then
the Storthing adopted the last resource provided by
the Constitution: it impeached the Ministers before
the Supreme Court of the kingdom. Political rancour
ran incredibly high, and there was a great final tussle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>over the composition of the Supreme Court; but the
Liberals were masters of the situation, and carried all
before them. One by one the Ministers were dismissed
from office and fined. The King ostentatiously
testified his sympathy with them, and selected a new
Ministry from the Extreme Right. They failed to
carry on the government of the country, and matters
were at a deadlock. At last, however, King Oscar
gave way. On June 26, 1884, he sent for Johan
Sverdrup, the statesman who for a quarter of a century
had guided the counsels of the Liberal party.
Sverdrup consented to form a Ministry, and the
battle ended in a Liberal victory along the whole
line.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ten years elapsed between Ibsen’s hegira of 1864
and his first brief return to his native land. Before
his second visit eleven more years intervened; and
during the summer of 1885, which he spent for the
most part at Molde, he found the air still quivering
with the rancours begotten of the great struggle. In
a speech which he addressed to a meeting of workmen
at Trondhjem (June 14, 1885) he said that the
years of his absence had brought “immense progress
in most directions,” but that he was disappointed to
observe that “the most indispensable individual
rights were far less secured than he had hoped and
expected to find them under the new order of things.”
He found neither freedom of thought nor freedom of
speech beyond a limit arbitrarily fixed by the dominant
majority. “There remains much to be done,” he
continued, “before we can be said to have attained
real liberty. But I fear that our present democracy
will not be equal to the task. An element of <em>nobility</em>
must be introduced into our national life, into our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>Parliament, and into our Press. Of course it is not
nobility of birth that I am thinking of, nor of money,
nor yet of knowledge, nor even of ability and talent:
I am thinking of nobility of character, of will, of
soul.”</p>

<p class='c001'>When he spoke these words he had been little more
than a week in Norway; but it is clear that <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>
was already germinating in his mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>On his return to Munich he began to think out the
play, and on February 14, 1886, he wrote to Carl
Snoilsky, the Swedish poet; “I am much taken up
with a new play, which I have long had in mind, and
for which I made careful studies during my visit to
Norway.” It may be mentioned that Ibsen had met
Snoilsky at Molde during the previous summer, and
that they had seen a good deal of each other. The
manuscript of <cite>Rosmersholm</cite> was sent to the printers
at the end of September 1886, and a letter to Hegel
accompanied it in which Ibsen said: “So far as I
can see, the play is not likely to call forth attacks
from any quarter; but I hope it will lead to lively
discussion. I look for this especially in Sweden.”
Why in Sweden? Perhaps because, as we shall see
presently, the story was partly suggested by a recent
episode in Swedish social history. Before proceeding
to the question of origins, however, I may quote the
only other reference to the play, of any importance,
which occurs in Ibsen’s letters. The chairman of a
debating-club in Christiania had addressed to the
poet a letter on behalf of the club, which apparently
contained some question or suggestion as to the
fundamental idea of the play. Ibsen’s answer was
dated Munich, February 13, 1887. “The call to
work,” he said, “is certainly distinguishable throughout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span><cite>Rosmersholm</cite>. But the play also deals with the
struggle with himself which every serious-minded
man must face in order to bring his life into harmony
with his convictions. For the different spiritual
functions do not develop evenly and side by side in
any given human being. The acquisitive instinct
hastens on from conquest to conquest. The moral
consciousness, the ‘conscience,’ on the other hand, is
very conservative. It has deep roots in tradition and
the past generally. Hence arises the conflict in the
individual. But first and foremost, of course, the
play is a creative work, dealing with human beings
and human destinies.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. George Brandes is our authority for associating
<cite>Rosmersholm</cite> with the social episode above alluded
to—an episode which came within Ibsen’s ken just
while the play was in process of gestation. A Swedish
nobleman, personally known to Ibsen, and remarkable
for that amenity and distinction of manner which he
attributes to Rosmer, had been unhappily married to
a lady who shared none of his interests, and was intellectually
quite unsympathetic to him. Much more
sympathetic was a female relative of his wife’s.
The relation between them attracted attention, and
(as in <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>) was the subject of venomous
paragraphs in the local Press. Count Blank left his
home and went abroad, was joined by the sympathetic
cousin, resigned the high office which he held in his
native country, and returned to his wife the fortune
she had brought him. Shortly afterwards the Countess
died of consumption, which was, of course, supposed
to have been accelerated by her husband’s misconduct.
The use that Ibsen made of this unhappy story affords
a perfect example of the working-up of raw material
in the factory of genius. Not one of the traits that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>constitute the originality and greatness of the play is
to be found in the actual circumstances. He remodelled
the whole episode; it was plastic as a sculptor’s
clay in his hands; but doubtless it did give him
something to seize upon and re-create. For the character
of Rebecca, it is believed (on rather inadequate
grounds, it seems to me) that Ibsen borrowed some
traits from Charlotte Stieglitz, who committed suicide
in 1834, in the vain hope of stimulating the intellectual
activity of her husband, a minor poet.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> For Ulric
Brendel, Dr. Brahm relates that Ibsen found a model in
an eccentric “dream-genius” known to him in Italy,
who created only in his mind, and despised writing. But
Brendel is so clearly a piece of the poet’s own “devilment”
as he used to call it, that it is rather idle to
look for his “original.” The scene of the play is
said to have been suggested to Ibsen by an old
family seat near Molde. Be this as it may, Dr.
Brandes is certainly mistaken in declaring that there
is no such “castle” as Rosmersholm in Norway, and
thence arguing that Ibsen had begun to write for a
cosmopolitan rather than a Norwegian audience.
Rosmersholm is not a “castle” at all; and old
houses such as Ibsen describes are far from uncommon.</p>

<p class='c001'>Published on November 23, 1886, <cite>Rosmersholm</cite> was
first acted in Bergen in January 1887, in Gothenburg
in March, in Christiania and Stockholm not till April.
Copenhagen did not see it until November 1887, when
it was acted by a Swedish travelling company. Its
first production in Germany took place at Augsburg in
April 1887, the poet himself being present. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>produced in Berlin in May 1887, in Vienna not till May
1893. There are few of the leading German theatres
where it has not been acted, and has not taken a more
or less prominent place in the repertory. In Germany
indeed (though not elsewhere) it seems to rank
among Ibsen’s most popular works. In London
<cite>Rosmersholm</cite> was first acted at the Vaudeville Theatre
on February 23, 1891, Mr. F. R. Benson playing
Rosmer, and Miss Florence Farr, Rebecca. Four performances
of it were given at the Opera Comique in
1893, with Mr. Lewis Waller as Rosmer, and Miss Elizabeth Robins
as Rebecca. In 1892, a writer who
adopted the pseudonym of “Austin Fryers” produced,
at the Globe Theatre, a play called <cite>Beata</cite>, which
purported to be a “prologue” to <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>—the
drama which Ibsen (perversely in Mr. Fryers’ judgment)
chose to narrate instead of exhibiting it in
action. Not until 1893 was <cite>Rosmersholm</cite> produced
in Paris, by the company entitled <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“L’Œuvre,”</span> under
the direction of M. Lugnê Poé. This company afterwards
acted it in London and in many other cities—among
the rest in Christiania. In Italy, Eleonora
Duse has recently added the play to her repertory,
with scenery designed by Mr. Gordon Craig. I have
no record of any American production.</p>

<p class='c001'>With <cite>Rosmersholm</cite> we reach the end of the series
of social dramas which began seventeen years earlier
with <cite>The League of Youth</cite>. In all these plays the
individual is treated, more or less explicitly, as a social
unit, a member of a class, an example of some collective
characteristic, or a victim of some collective
superstition, injustice or stupidity. The plays which
follow, on the other hand, beginning with <cite>The Lady
from the Sea</cite>, are plays of pure psychology. There
are, no doubt, many women like Ellida Wangel or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>Hedda Gabler; but it is as individuals, not as members
of a class, that they interest us; nor is their fate
conditioned, like that of Nora or Mrs. Alving, by
any social prejudice or pressure. But in <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>
man is still considered as a “political animal.” The
play, as we have seen, actually took its rise as a protest
against a morbid condition of the Norwegian
public mind, as observed by the poet at a particular
point of time. George Brandes, indeed, has very
justly contended that it ought to rank with <cite>An Enemy
of the People</cite> and <cite>The Wild Duck</cite> as a direct outcome
of that momentous incident in Ibsen’s career, the
fierce attack upon <cite>Ghosts</cite>. “Rosmer,” says Dr. Brandes,
“begins where Stockmann left off. He
wants to do from the very first what the doctor only
wanted to do at the end of <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>—to
make proud, free, noble beings of his countrymen.
At the beginning of the play, Rosmer is believed to
be a decided Conservative (which the Norwegian
considered Ibsen to be for many years after <cite>The
League of Youth</cite>), and as long as this view is generally
held, he is esteemed and admired, while everything
that concerns him is interpreted in the most favourable
manner. As soon, however, as his complete
intellectual emancipation is discovered, and especially
when it appears that he himself does not attempt to
conceal the change in his views, public opinion turns
against him.... Ibsen had been almost as much
exposed as Rosmer to every sort of attack for some
time after the publication of <cite>Ghosts</cite>, which (from the
Conservative point of view) marked his conversion to
Radicalism.” The analogy between Ibsen’s experience
and Rosmer’s is far too striking not to have been
present to the poet’s mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, though the play distinctly belongs to the social
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>series, it no less distinctly foreshadows the transition
to the psychological series. Rosmer and Rebecca (or I
am greatly mistaken) stand out from the social background
much more clearly than their predecessors.
They seem to grow away from it. At first they are
concerned about political duties and social ideals; but,
as the action proceeds, all these considerations drop
away from them, or recur but as remembered dreams,
and they are alone with their tortured souls. Then we
cannot but note the intrusion of pure poetry—imagination
scarcely deigning to allege a realistic pretext—in
the personage of Ulric Brendel. He is of the same
kindred as the Stranger in <cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite>, and
the Rat-Wife in <cite>Little Eyolf</cite>. He marks Ibsen’s final
rebellion against the prosaic restrictions which, from
<cite>Pillars of Society</cite> onwards, he had striven to impose
upon his genius.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was yet to write plays more fascinating than
<cite>Romersholm</cite>, but none greater in point of technical
mastery. It surpasses <cite>The Wild Duck</cite> in the simplicity
of its material, and in that concentration which
renders its effect on the stage, perhaps, a little monotonous,
and so detracts from its popularity. In construction
it is a very marvel of cunning complexity. It
is the consummate example in modern times of the
retrospective method of which, in ancient times, the
consummate example was the <cite>Œdipus Rex</cite>. This
method has been blamed by many critics; but the first
great critic of English drama commended it in the
practice of the ancient poets. “They set the audience,
as it were,” says Dryden, “at the post where the race
is to be concluded.” “In unskilful hands,” I have said
elsewhere, “the method might doubtless become very
tedious; but when, as in <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>, every phase
of the retrospect has a definite reaction upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>drama—the psychological process—actually passing on
the stage, the effect attained is surely one of peculiar
richness and depth. The drama of the past and the
drama of the present are interwoven in such a complex
yet clear and stately harmony as Ibsen himself has
not often rivalled.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>THE LADY FROM THE SEA <br /> <br /> INTRODUCTION</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Ibsen’s birth-place, Skien, is not on the sea, but at the
head of a long and very narrow fiord. At Grimstad,
however, and again at Bergen, he had for years lived
close to the skerry-bound coast. After he left Bergen,
he seldom came in touch with the open sea. The upper
part of Christiania Fiord is a mere salt-water lake;
and in Germany he never saw the sea, in Italy only on
brief visits to Ischia, Sorrento, Amalfi. We find him,
in 1880,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> writing to Hegel from Munich: “Of all
that I miss down here, I miss the sea most. That is
the deprivation to which I can least reconcile <a id='corrxix.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='myself.’'>myself.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_xix.13'><ins class='correction' title='myself.’'>myself.”</ins></a></span>
Again, in 1885, before the visit which he paid that
year to Norway, he writes from Rome to the same
correspondent, that he has visions of buying a country-house
by the sea, in the neighbourhood of Christiania.
“The sight of the sea,” he says, “is what I most miss
in these regions; and this feeling grows year by year.”
During the weeks he spent at Molde that year, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>can be no doubt that he was gathering not only the
political impressions which he used in <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>,
but the impressions of ocean and fiord, and of the tide
of European life flowing past, but not mingling with,
the “carp-pond” existence of a small Norwegian town,
which he was afterwards to embody in <cite>The Lady from
the Sea</cite>. That invaluable bibliographer, Halvorsen, is
almost certainly wrong in suggesting that Veblungsnes,
at the head of the Romsdalfiord, is the scene of the
play. The “local situation” is much more like that
of Molde itself. There Ibsen must frequently have
seen the great English tourist steamer gliding noiselessly
to its moorings, before proceeding up the fiord
to Veblungsnes, and then, on the following day, slipping
out to sea again.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two years later, in 1887, Ibsen spent the summer at
Frederikshavn and at Sæby in the north of Jutland,
not far from the Skaw. At Sæby I visited him; and
from a letter written at the time I make the following
extract: “He said that Fru Ibsen and he had first
come to Frederikshavn, which he himself liked very
much—he could knock about all day among the shipping,
talking to the sailors, and so forth. Besides, he
found the neighbourhood of the sea favourable to
contemplation and constructive thought. Here, at
Sæby, the sea was not so easily accessible. But Fru
Ibsen didn’t like Frederikshavn because of the absence
of pleasant walks about it; so Sæby was a sort of
compromise between him and her.” I remember that
he enlarged to me at great length on the fascination
which the sea exercised over him. He was then, he
said, “preparing some tomfoolery for next year.” On
his return to Munich, he put his ideas into shape, and
<cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite> was published in November
1888.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>Ibsen wrote few letters while the play was in process
of preparation, and none of them contains any
noteworthy reference to it. On the other hand, we
possess a very curious first draft of the story<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> (dated
March 5, 1880), which shows in a most interesting
fashion how an idea grew in his mind. Abbreviating
freely, I will try to indicate the main points of difference
between the sketch and the finished play.</p>

<p class='c001'>The scene of the action was originally conceived as
a much smaller town than it ultimately became, shut
in and overshadowed by high, abrupt rocks. (Note that
when he wrote the sketch Ibsen had not yet visited
Molde.) There was to be an hotel and a sanatorium,
and a good deal of summer gaiety in the place; but
the people were to long in an impotent, will-less
fashion for release from their imprisonment in the
“shadow-life” of this remote corner of the world.
Through the short summer, they were always to have
the long winter impending over them; and this was
to be a type of life: “A bright summer day with the
great darkness behind it—that is all.” This motive,
though traces of it remain, is much less emphasized
than was at first intended.</p>

<p class='c001'>The characters were to fall into three groups: inhabitants
of the town, summer visitors, and passing
tourists. The tourists were simply to “come and go,
and enter episodically into the action”; but the other
two groups are more or less individualised.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first group is thus described: “The lawyer
married a second time, to the woman from the open sea
outside. Has two young but grown-up daughters by
his first marriage. Elegant, distinguished, bitter. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>past tarnished by an indiscretion. His career thereby
cut short. The disreputable signboard-painter with
the artist-dreams, happy in his imaginings. The old,
married clerk. Has written a play in his youth, which
was only once acted.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Is for ever touching it up, and
lives in the illusion that it will be published and will
make a great success. Takes no steps, however, to
bring this about. Nevertheless, accounts himself one
of the ‘literary’ class. His wife and children believe
blindly in the play. (Perhaps a private tutor, not a
clerk.) Tailor Fresvik, the man-midwife of radicalism,
who shows his ‘emancipation’ in ludicrous attempts
at debauchery—affairs with other men’s wives—talks
of divorce and so forth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>We see that, in the course of elaboration, not only
the profession, but the character of Wangel was
entirely altered. It is noteworthy, by the way, that,
with Ibsen, lawyers are always more or less unsympathetic
characters (Stensgård, Helmer, Krogstad, Brack)
while doctors are more or less sympathetic (Fieldbo,
Rank, Stockmann, Relling, Wangel, Herdal). We
see, too, how he saved up for seventeen years the character
of the clerk-dramatist. Found superfluous in
<cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite>, he became the delightful
Foldal of <cite>John Gabriel Borkman</cite>. The radical tailor
was destined never to come to life; and the characteristics
of the “signboard-painter” were divided
between Ballested and Lyngstrand.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the second group, however—that of the summer
visitors—the consumptive sculptor Lyngstrand is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>already pretty completely sketched. The group was
also to have included Lyngstrand’s “patron” and
his patron’s wife—a “stupid, uppish, and tactless
woman, who wounds the patient sometimes without
meaning it, sometimes on purpose.” The patron’s
wife has entirely disappeared from the completed play,
while the patron, though mentioned, has not even a
name.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the oddest fact which this sketch brings to light
is that Arnholm and the Stranger were formed by the
scission, so to speak, of one character, denominated
the “Strange Passenger.” Ellida<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> was originally to
have been a pastor’s daughter. She was to have engaged
herself secretly to a “young and unprincipled
mate”—a midshipman dismissed the navy. This
engagement she broke off, partly at her father’s command,
partly of her own free will, because she could
not forgive what she had learnt of the young sailor’s
past. Then, after her marriage, she came to feel that
in her ignorance and prejudice she had been too hard
on him, and to believe that “essentially—in her imagination—it
was with him that she had led her married
life.” This is very like the feeling of Ellida in the
play; but her story has become much more strange
and romantic. It is not quite clear—the sketch being
incomplete—whether the ex-midshipman was to have
appeared in person. But there was to have been a
“Strange Passenger” (so nicknamed by the other
summer visitors) who had been in love with Ellida
in the old days, and of whom she was now to
make a confidant, very much as she does of Arnholm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>in the play. His character, however, was to have been
quite unlike that of Arnholm; he was to have been
“bitter, and given to cutting jests”—somewhat reminiscent,
in fact, of the Strange Passenger in <cite>Peer Gynt</cite>.
Ibsen may have meant that the nickname should be
given him in allusion to that figure. We see, at any
rate, that the Strange Passenger, in his capacity as
Ellida’s confidant, became Arnholm, who is not in the
least strange; while the strangeness was transferred
to Ellida’s former lover, who, originally conceived as a
comparatively commonplace personage, now became
distinctively “the Stranger.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Fragments of dialogue are roughly sketched—especially
the young sculptor’s story of the shipwreck and
of the group it has suggested to him. Ellida’s fancy that
mankind has taken a wrong turning in developing into
land-animals instead of water-animals is rather more
carefully worked out in the sketch than in the play.
It takes the form of a semi-serious biological theory,
not attributed to any particular character: “Why
should we belong to the dry land? Why not to the
air? Why not to the sea? The common longing
for wings—the strange dreams that one can fly, and
that one does fly without feeling the least surprise at
the fact—how is all this to be explained?” The
suggestion evidently is that these dreams are reminiscences
of the bird stage in our development;
and then the poet goes on to suggest the same explanation
of the intense longing for the sea which he
attributes to Ellida: “People who are akin to the
sea. Bound to the sea. Dependent on the sea.
Must get back to it. A fish-species forms the primordial
link in the evolutionary chain. Do rudiments
of it survive in our nature? In the nature of some
of us?” He also indicates a fantasy of floating cities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>to be towed southwards or northwards according to
the season. “To learn to control storms and the
weather. Some such glorious time will come. And
we—we shall not be there to see it.” All this over-luxuriant
growth of fantasy has been carefully pruned
in the completed play.</p>

<p class='c001'>The main incidents of the first act are sketched out
in a form not very different from that which they
ultimately assumed—and there the scenario breaks
off.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Stranger’s dæmonic power over Ellida was suggested,”
says John Paulsen, “by Welhaven’s strange
influence over Camilla Wergeland;” while Dr. Brahm
asserts “on credible authority” that the incident of
the rings thrown into the sea reproduces an episode of
Ibsen’s own early life in Bergen. Until the “credible
authority” is more clearly specified, we need not pin
our faith to the latter assertion; but the former
receives some confirmation in a letter which Ibsen
addressed on May 3, 1889, to the lady whom Paulsen
mentions. This was Camilla Collett, born Wergeland,
a sister of the great lyric poet, Henrik Wergeland,
and the authoress of a book, <cite>From the Camp of
the Dumb</cite> (1877), which is said to have greatly influenced
Ibsen’s attitude towards the woman-question,
and to have stimulated him to the production of <i>A
Doll’s House</i>. I do not know the story of her relation
to J. S. C. Welhaven, a distinguished poet, and her
brother’s chief rival; but it is clear from Ibsen’s
letter that she was in some way present to his mind
during the composition of <cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite>.
This is what he wrote: “Allow me to send you a
few words of very sincere thanks for your comprehension
of <cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite>. I felt pretty sure in
advance that from you more than any one else I could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>rely upon such comprehension; but it gave me inexpressible
pleasure to find my hope confirmed by your
letter. Yes, there are points of resemblance—indeed
many. And you have seen and felt them—points, I
mean, which I could arrive at only by divination.
But it is now many years since you, in virtue of your
spiritual development, began, in one form or another,
to make your presence felt in my work.” Camilla
Collett died in 1895, at the age of eighty-two.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nowhere has <cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite> proved one of
Ibsen’s most popular works. It was acted in all the
Scandinavian capitals, and in several German cities,
in February and March 1889. The poet himself was
present at the first performance at the Royal Theatre,
Berlin, on March 4, and afterwards (March 14) at a
performance at Weimar, where he was called before
the curtain after each act, and received a laurel
wreath. In a letter to Hoffory, he expressed himself
delighted with the actor who played the Stranger
at Weimar; “I could not desire, and could scarcely
conceive, a better embodiment of the part—a long
gaunt figure, with hawk-like features, piercing black
eyes, and a fine, deep, veiled voice.” The play holds
the stage here and there in Germany, but is not very
frequently acted.</p>

<p class='c001'>In London, five performances of Mrs. Marx-Aveling’s
translation were given, under the direction
of Dr. Aveling, at Terry’s Theatre in May 1891—the
year of the first performance in England of <cite>Ghosts</cite>,
<cite>Rosmersholm</cite> and <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite>. This wholly inadequate
production was followed, eleven years later,
by a revival at the Royalty Theatre, by the Stage
Society, in which Ellida was played by Miss Janet Achurch,
and the Stranger by Mr. Laurence Irving.
In Paris, an organisation  calling itself “Les
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>Escholiers,” produced <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>La Dame de la Mer</cite></span> in 1892.
It was afterwards played, both in Paris and on tour,
by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre de l’Œuvre</span>. I find no record of
performances in other countries.</p>

<p class='c001'>The discovery that <cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite> was
planned so early as 1880 is particularly interesting in
view of the fact that, in technical concentration, and
even, one is inclined to say, in intellectual power, it
falls notably below the level of its immediate predecessors,
<cite>The Wild Duck</cite> and <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>, and its
immediate successors, <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite> and <cite>The Master
Builder</cite>. It would scarcely be going too far to call it
the weakest thing Ibsen produced between <i>A Doll’s
House</i> and <cite>John Gabriel Borkman</cite>, both inclusive. I
well remember the sense of slackening dramatic fibre
with which I read it on its first appearance; the fear
that age was beginning to tell upon the poet; and the
relief with which I found him, in <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite>, once
more at the very height of his power. Some readers
may take exception to this view, and declare that they
prefer <cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite> to several of the plays
which I would rank above it. In point of amenity
and charm, it doubtless ranks high among Ibsen’s
works; its poetic merits are great; but the comparative
laxity of its technique seems to me quite
unmistakable. The main interest—the Ellida-Wangel
interest, let us call it—is constantly being interrupted
by two subsidiary interests: the Arnholm-Boletta
interest, and the Boletta-Hilda-Lyngstrand interest.
These lines of interest touch each other, but are not
effectually interwoven. In no other play of Ibsen’s,
in fact, since <cite>The League of Youth</cite>, is there such a
marked sub-plot, or, rather, two sub-plots; and, for
my part, judging them by the high Ibsen standard, I
find neither of these sub-plots particularly interesting.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>The main action, on the other hand, is not only interesting
but full of psychological truth. Ellida is one
of the most living of Ibsen’s women. There are
few of his heroines whom one has not seen and recognised
in real life; but Ellida in particular I happen
to have known intimately, though Ibsen never heard
of the lady in question. The character of Wangel,
too, is not only very amiable, but very closely observed.
Yet even in the working out of this main theme, there
is, I think, a technical weakness. We feel that, in the
decisive scene of the last act, Wangel’s mere statement
that he sets Ellida free is an insufficient pivot for the
revolution which takes place in her mind. Psychologically,
no doubt, it is adequate, but dramatically it
is ineffective. The poet ought, I suggest, to have
devised some more convincing means of bringing home
both to her and to us the fact of her manumission.
In default of a practical proof, a symbolic indication
might have served; but something we want beyond a
mere verbal declaration. It may be taken as a technical
principle, I believe, that a change of mind on
which so much depends ought, for purposes of dramatic
effect, to be demonstrated by some outward and
visible sign sufficiently cogent to make the audience
fully realise and believe in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another technical weakness, more obvious, though
perhaps less important, is the astounding coincidence
by which Lyngstrand, the one witness to the Stranger’s
frenzy on reading of Ellida’s faithlessness, is made, by
pure chance, to encounter Ellida and to tell her the
story.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> This is, I think, the only real abuse of coincidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>in Ibsen’s modern plays, from <cite>Pillars of Society</cite>
onwards. One or two other much slighter coincidences—such
as, in <i>A Doll’s House</i>, Mrs. Linden’s former
acquaintance with Krogstad—are accounted for by the
fact that Norway is a very small country, in which,
roughly speaking, every one of the town-dwelling
upper and middle class knows, or has heard of, every
one else.</p>

<p class='c001'>As I have pointed out in the introduction to <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>,
<cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite> is the first play in which
Ibsen entirely abandons social satire and devotes himself
to pure psychology. It is also the first play in
which he trenches on the occult. He was to go much
further in this direction in <cite>The Master Builder</cite> and
<cite>Little Eyolf</cite>; but already he pursues the plan, which
was also Hawthorne’s, of carefully leaving us in doubt
as to whether, and how far, any supernormal influence
is at work. On the whole, however, he probably
intends us to conclude that the Stranger’s uncanny
power over Ellida exists only in her imagination.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. I met in Rome, in 1881-82, when Ibsen was living there,
a minor official of the Vatican Library, then a middle-aged
man, who had written eighteen or twenty tragedies,
all of which I saw in exquisite manuscript. One of them,
<cite>Coriolano</cite>, had been acted once, on the day, I think, before the
Italian troops entered Rome in 1870. Is it possible that Ibsen,
too, had come across this rival dramatist?</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. The name originally assigned her was “Thora.” Readers
who know anything of Norway will probably realise how absolutely
right was the substitution of “Ellida.” It is a masterstroke
in the art of nomenclature.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. It is suggested that the coincidence is to be regarded as
part of the “occult” atmosphere of the play. But I doubt
whether this was in the poet’s mind; and, in any case, the
defence does not seem a very good one.</p>

against it—nothing in <em class='gesperrt'>your</em> case.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, surely not. One likes to know what’s going
on—to keep up with the time——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And of course I should not think of expecting
you, as a woman, to side actively with either party
in the civil contest—I might almost say the civil
war—that is raging among us.—But you have seen
then, I suppose, how these gentlemen of “the
people” have been pleased to treat me? What
infamous abuse they have had the audacity to heap
on me?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; but it seems to me you gave as good as
you got.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>So I did, though I say it that shouldn’t. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>now I have tasted blood; and they shall soon find
to their cost that I am not the man to turn the
other cheek——[<i>Breaks off.</i>] But come come—don’t
let us get upon that subject this evening—it’s
too painful and irritating.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh no, don’t let us talk of it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Tell me now—how do you get on at Rosmersholm,
now that you are alone. Since our poor Beata——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Thank you, I get on very well. Of course one
feels a great blank in many ways—a great sorrow
and longing. But otherwise——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And do you think of remaining here?—permanently,
I mean.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My dear Rector, I really haven’t thought about
it, one way or the other. I have got so used to
the place now, that I feel almost as if I belonged
to it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, of course you belong to it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And so long as Mr. Rosmer finds that I am of
any use or comfort to him—why, so long, I suppose,
I shall stay here.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Looks at her with emotion.</i>] Do you know,—it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>really fine for a woman to sacrifice her whole youth
to others as you have done.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, what else should I have had to live for?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>First, there was your untiring devotion to your
paralytic and exacting foster-father——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You mustn’t suppose that Dr. West was such a
charge when we were up in Finmark. It was those
terrible boat-voyages up there that broke him
down. But after we came here—well yes, the two
years before he found rest were certainly hard
enough.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And the years that followed—were they not even
harder for you?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh how can you say such a thing? When I was
so fond of Beata—and when she, poor dear, stood
so sadly in need of care and forbearance.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How good it is of you to think of her with so

    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Moves a little nearer.</i>] My dear Rector, you say
that with such a ring of sincerity that I cannot
think there is any ill-feeling lurking in the background.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ill-feeling? Why, what do you mean?</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, it would be only natural if you felt it
painful to see a stranger managing the household
here at Rosmersholm.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, how on earth——!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But you have no such feeling? [<i>Takes his hand.</i>]

again.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How on earth did you get such an idea into your
head?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I began to be a little afraid when your visits

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then you have been on a totally wrong scent,
Miss West. Besides—after all, there has been no
essential change. Even while poor Beata was
alive—in her last unhappy days—it was you, and
you alone, that managed everything.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That was only a sort of regency in Beata’s name.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Be that as it may——. Do you know, Miss West—for
my part, I should have no objection
whatever if you——. But I suppose I mustn’t
say such a thing.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Interrupting gravely.</i>] For shame, Rector Kroll.

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh well, our good Johannes Rosmer very likely

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You are really too absurd, Rector.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless——. Tell me, Miss West—if you
will forgive the question—what is your age?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Indeed. And Rosmer—how old is he? Let me

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, many thanks; I thought of staying. There
is a matter I want to discuss with our good friend.—And
I suppose, Miss West, in case you should
take fancies into your head again, I had better
come out pretty often for the future—as I used to
in the old days.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Gently and softly, pressing his hands.</i>] Welcome
back to this house, my dear Kroll. [<i>Lays his hands
on</i> <span class='sc'>Kroll’s</span> <i>shoulders and looks into his eyes.</i>] My

things would come all right between us.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, my dear fellow—do you mean to say you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>too have been so foolish as to fancy there was anything
wrong?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Rosmer</span>.] Yes, only think,—it was nothing

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Is that really the case, Kroll? Then why did
you desert us so entirely?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Gravely, in a low voice.</i>] Because my presence
would always have been reminding you of the
years of your unhappiness, and of—the life that
ended in the mill-race.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, it was a kind thought—you were always
considerate. But it was quite unnecessary to remain
away on that account.—Come, sit here on
the sofa. [<i>They sit down.</i>] No, I assure you, the
thought of Beata has no pain for me. We speak
of her every day. We feel almost as if she were
still one of the household.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Lighting the lamp.</i>] Yes, indeed we do.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It is quite natural. We were both so deeply
attached to her. And both Rebec—both Miss
West and I know that we did all that was possible
for her in her affliction. We have nothing to
reproach ourselves with.—So I feel nothing but a
tranquil tenderness now at the thought of Beata.</p>

<p class='c001'>[<i>With some hesitation.</i>] My dear Kroll—I wish
very much that our intercourse had never been

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, and I have always been proud of the office.

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>There are many things that I would give a great
deal to talk over with you, quite frankly—straight
from the heart.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Oh I can tell you I have still more to talk to

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I was forced into it in spite of myself. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>impossible to stand idly looking on any longer.
Now that the Radicals have unhappily come into
power, it is high time something should be done,—so
I have got our little group of friends in the
town to close up their ranks. I tell you it is high
time!</p>

  </div>

<p class='c001'>Unquestionably it would have been better if we
had checked the stream at an earlier point in its
course. But who could foresee what was going to
happen? Certainly not I. [<i>Rises and walks up and

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I tell you it has—into my own school. What do
you think? It has come to my knowledge that
the sixth-form boys—a number of them at any

<p class='c001'>Yes; nice mental sustenance for future government
officials, is it not? But the worst of it is
that it’s all the cleverest boys in the form that
have banded together in this conspiracy against

what has happened?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Would you believe that my own children——In
short, it is Laurits that is the ringleader of the
school conspiracy; and Hilda has embroidered a
red portfolio to keep the “Beacon” in.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I should certainly never have dreamt that, in

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, who would have dreamt of such a thing?
In my house, the very home of obedience and
order—where one will, and one only, has always
prevailed——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How does your wife take all this?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, that is the most incredible part of it. My
wife, who all her life long has shared my opinions
and concurred in my views, both in great things
and small—she is actually inclined to side with
the children on many points. And she blames <em class='gesperrt'>me</em>
for what has happened. She says I tyrannise over
the children. As if it weren’t necessary to——.
Well, you see how my house is divided against
itself. But of course I say as little about it as
possible. Such things are best kept quiet.

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Comes forward.</i>] Well, my dear Rosmer, now
you know how the spirit of the age has overshadowed
both my domestic and my official life.
And am I to refrain from combating this pernicious,
subversive, anarchic spirit, with any
weapon I can lay my hands on? Fight it I will,
trust me for that; both with tongue and pen.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>At any rate I shall have done my duty as a
citizen in defence of the State. And I hold it
the duty of every right-minded man with an atom
of patriotism to do likewise. In fact—that was
my principal reason for coming out here this
evening.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, my dear Kroll, what do you mean——?
What can I——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>

<p class='c001'>You can stand by your old friends. Do as we

<p class='c001'>But, Rector Kroll, you know Mr. Rosmer’s distaste

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>He must get over his distaste.—You don’t keep
abreast of things, Rosmer. You bury yourself
alive here, with your historical collections. Far
be it from me to speak disrespectfully of family
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>trees and so forth; but, unfortunately, this is no
time for hobbies of that sort. You cannot imagine
the state things are in, all over the country.
There is hardly a single accepted idea that hasn’t
been turned topsy-turvy. It will be a gigantic
task to get all the errors rooted out again.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have no doubt of it. But I am the last man
to undertake such a task.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And besides, I think Mr. Rosmer has come to
take a wider view of life than he used to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>With surprise.</i>] Wider?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; or freer, if you like—less one-sided.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What is the meaning of this? Rosmer—surely
you are not so weak as to be influenced by the
accident that the leaders of the mob have won a
temporary advantage?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My dear Kroll, you know how little I understand
of politics. But I confess it seems to me that
within the last few years people are beginning to
show greater independence of thought.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Indeed! And you take it for granted that that
must be an improvement! But in any case you are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>quite mistaken, my friend. Just inquire a little into
the opinions that are current among the Radicals,
both out here and in the town. They are neither
more nor less than the wisdom that’s retailed in
the “Beacon.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; Mortensgård has great influence over many
people hereabouts.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, just think of it! A man of his foul antecedents—a
creature that was turned out of his
place as a schoolmaster on account of his immoral
life! A fellow like that sets himself up as a leader
of the people! And succeeds too! Actually
succeeds! I hear he is going to enlarge his paper.
I know on good authority that he is on the lookout
for a capable assistant.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I wonder that you and your friends don’t set up
an opposition to him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That is the very thing we are going to do. We
have to-day bought the <cite>County News</cite>; there was
no difficulty about the money question. But——[<i>Turns
to</i> <span class='sc'>Rosmer</span>.] Now I come to my real
errand. The difficulty lies in the conduct of the
paper—the editing——. Tell me, Rosmer,—don’t
you feel it your duty to undertake it, for the sake
of the good cause?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, how can you think of such a thing?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I can quite understand your horror of public
meetings, and your reluctance to expose yourself
to their tender mercies. But an editor’s work is
less conspicuous, or rather——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No no, my dear friend, you must not ask me to
do this.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I should be quite willing to try my own hand at
<em class='gesperrt'>that</em> style of work too; but I couldn’t possibly
manage it. I have such a multitude of irons in the
fire already. But for you, with no profession to
tie you down——. Of course the rest of us would
give you as much help as we could.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I cannot, Kroll. I am not fitted for it.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not fitted? You said the same thing when your

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, the mere name, Johannes Rosmer, will be
a great thing for the paper. We others are looked
upon as confirmed partisans—indeed I hear I am
denounced as a desperate fanatic—so that if we
work the paper in our own names, we can’t reckon
upon its making much way among the misguided
masses. You, on the contrary, have always kept
out of the fight. Everybody knows and values
your humanity and uprightness—your delicacy of
mind—your unimpeachable honour. And then the
prestige of your former position as a clergyman still
clings to you; and, to crown all, you have your
grand old family name!</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>with a sort of introduction. I can give you news
of Ulric Brendel.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Has he called on you?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No. He took up his quarters in a low public-house—in
the lowest company of course—and
drank and stood treat as long as he had any
money. Then he began abusing the whole company
as a set of disreputable blackguards—and so
far he was quite right—whereupon they thrashed
him and pitched him out into the gutter.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>So he is incorrigible after all.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>He had pawned the coat too; but I am told
that has been redeemed for him. Can you guess
by whom?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps by you?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No; by the distinguished Mr. Mortensgård.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah, indeed.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I understand that Mr. Brendel’s first visit was
to the “idiot” and “plebeian.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, it was lucky for him——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>To be sure it was. [<i>Leans over the table towards</i>
<span class='sc'>Rosmer</span>.] And that brings me to a matter it
is my duty to warn you about, for our old—for
our former friendship’s sake.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My dear Kroll, what can <em class='gesperrt'>that</em> be?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It is this: there are things going on behind
your back in this house.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How can you think so? Is it Reb—is it Miss
West you are aiming at?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Precisely. I can quite understand it on her
part. She has so long been accustomed to have
everything her own way here. But nevertheless——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My dear Kroll, you are utterly mistaken. She
and I—we have no concealments from each other
on any subject whatever.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Has she told you, then, that she has entered
into correspondence with the editor of the
“Beacon”?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, you are thinking of the few lines she sent
by Ulric Brendel?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then you <em class='gesperrt'>have</em> found it out. And do you
approve of her entering into relations with a
scurrilous scribbler, who never lets a week pass
without holding me up to ridicule, both as a
schoolmaster and as a public man?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My dear Kroll, I don’t suppose that side of the
matter ever entered her head. And besides, of
course she has full liberty of action, just as I have.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Indeed? Ah, no doubt that follows from your
new line of thought. For Miss West presumably
shares your present standpoint?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, she does. We two have worked our way
forward in faithful comradeship.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Looks at him and slowly shakes his head.</i>] Oh,
you blind, deluded being!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I? Why do you say that?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Because I dare not—I will not think the worst.
No no, let me say my say out.—You really do
value my friendship, Rosmer? And my respect
too? Do you not?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I surely need not answer that question.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, but there are other questions that do
require an answer—a full explanation on your
part.—Will you submit to a sort of investigation——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Investigation?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; will you let me question you about certain
things it may pain you to be reminded of? You
see—this apostasy of yours—well, this emancipation,
as you call it—is bound up with many other
things that for your own sake you must explain
to me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My dear Kroll, ask what questions you please.
I have nothing to conceal.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then tell me—what do you think was the real,
the ultimate reason why Beata put an end to her
life?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Can you have any doubt on the subject? Or,
rather, can you ask for reasons for what an unhappy,
irresponsible invalid may do?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Are you certain that Beata was completely irresponsible
for her actions? The doctors, at any
rate, were by no means convinced of it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>If the doctors had ever seen her as I have so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>often seen her, for days and nights together, they
would have had no doubts.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I had no doubts either—then.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh no, unhappily, there wasn’t the smallest
room for doubt. I have told you of her wild
frenzies of passion—which she expected me to
return. Oh, how they appalled me! And then
her causeless, consuming self-reproaches during
the last few years.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, when she had learnt that she must remain
childless all her life.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, just think of that! Such terrible, haunting
agony of mind about a thing utterly beyond
her control——! How could you call her responsible
for her actions?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>H’m———. Can you remember whether you
had any books in the house at that time treating
of the rationale of marriage—according to the
“advanced” ideas of the day.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I remember Miss West lending me a work of
the kind. The Doctor left her his library, you
know. But, my dear Kroll, you surely cannot
suppose we were so reckless as to let my poor
sick wife get hold of any such ideas? I can
solemnly assure you that the fault was not ours.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>It was her own distempered brain that drove her
into these wild aberrations.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>One thing at any rate I can tell you; and that
is, that poor, overstrung, tortured Beata put an
end to her life in order that you might live happily—live
freely, and—after your own heart.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Starts half up from his chair.</i>] What do you
mean by that?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Listen to me quietly, Rosmer; for now I can
speak of it. In the last year of her life she came
to me twice to pour forth all her anguish and
despair.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>On this same subject?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No. The first time she came, it was to declare
that you were on the road to perversion—that you
were going to break with the faith of your
fathers.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Eagerly.</i>] What you say is impossible, Kroll!
Absolutely impossible! You must be mistaken.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And why?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Because while Beata was alive I was still
wrestling with myself in doubt. And that fight I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>fought out alone and in utter silence, I don’t
think even Rebecca——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Rebecca?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh well—Miss West. I call her Rebecca for
convenience’ sake.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>So I have remarked.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>So it is inconceivable to me how Beata could
have got hold of the idea. And why did she not
speak to me myself about it? She never did—she
never said a single word.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Poor creature—she begged and implored <em class='gesperrt'>me</em>
to talk to you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And why did you not?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>At that time I never for a moment doubted
that she was out of her mind. Such an accusation
against a man like you!—And then she came
again—about a month later. This time she
seemed outwardly calmer; but as she was going
she said: “They may soon expect the White
Horse at Rosmersholm now.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, yes. The White Horse—she often spoke
of it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And when I tried to divert her mind from such
melancholy fancies, she only answered: “I have
not long to live; for Johannes must marry Rebecca
at once.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Almost speechless.</i>] What do you say? I
marry——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That was on a Thursday afternoon——. On
the Saturday evening she threw herself from the
bridge into the mill-race.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And you never warned us——!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You know very well how often she used to say
that she felt her end was near.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I know. But nevertheless—you <em class='gesperrt'>should</em>
have warned us!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I did think of it; but not till too late.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But afterwards, why did you not——? Why
have you said nothing about all this?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What good would it have done for me to come
torturing and harassing you still further? I took
all she said for mere wild, empty ravings—until
yesterday evening.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then you have now changed your opinion?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Did not Beata see quite clearly when she
declared you were about to desert the faith of
your fathers?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Looks fixedly, straight before him.</i>] I cannot
understand it. It is the most incomprehensible
thing in the world.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Incomprehensible or not—there it is. And
now I ask you, Rosmer,—how much truth is there
in her other accusation? The last one, I mean.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Accusation? Was <em class='gesperrt'>that</em> an accusation?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps you did not notice the way she worded
it. She had to go, she said—why?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In order that I might marry Rebecca——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>These were not precisely her words. Beata
used a different expression. She said: “I have
not long to live; for Johannes <em class='gesperrt'>must</em> marry
Rebecca <em class='gesperrt'>at once</em>.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Looks at him for a moment; then rises.</i>] Now

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And what then? What is your answer?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Still quiet and self-restrained.</i>] To such an

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Stands in front of him.</i>] Listen to me. For more
than a year—ever since Beata left us—Rebecca
West and I have lived alone here at Rosmersholm.
During all that time you have known of Beata’s
accusation against us. But I have never for a

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Listen to me. I am not going to inquire too
closely into the secret history of what went on
here in Beata’s lifetime—and may still be going
on. I know that your marriage was a most unhappy
one; and I suppose that must be taken as
some sort of excuse——</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Kroll.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Don’t interrupt me. What I mean is this: if
your present mode of life with Miss West is to
continue, it is absolutely necessary that the change
of views—the unhappy backsliding—brought
about by her evil influence, should be hushed up.
Let me speak! Let me speak! I say, if the
worst comes to the worst, in Heaven’s name think
and believe whatever you like about everything
under the sun. But you must keep your views to
yourself. These things are purely personal matters,
after all. There is no need to proclaim them from
the housetops.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But you have a duty towards the traditions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>your race, Rosmer! Remember that! Rosmersholm
has, so to speak, radiated morality and order
from time immemorial—yes, and respectful conformity
to all that is accepted and sanctioned by
the best people. The whole district has taken its
stamp from Rosmersholm. It would lead to deplorable,
irremediable confusion if it were known
that you had broken with what I may call the
hereditary idea of the house of Rosmer.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My dear Kroll, I cannot see the matter in that

spread a little light and gladness here, where the

<p class='c001'>[<i>Looks at him severely.</i>] Yes, that would be a
worthy life-work for the last of your race! No,
Rosmer; let such things alone; you are the last
man for such a task. You were born to be a quiet
student.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps so. But for once in a way I mean to

<p class='c001'>Well you see, Pastor Rosmer—you probably

I do. But, since you have come over to the

you intend to take an active share in the movement—I

that if you openly declare your defection from the
Church, you tie your own hands at the very outset.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Do you think so?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; believe me, you won’t be able to do much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>for the cause, in this part of the country at any
rate. And besides—we have plenty of freethinkers
already, Pastor Rosmer—I might almost
say too many. What the party requires, is a
Christian element—something that every one must
respect. <em class='gesperrt'>That</em> is what we are sadly in need of.
And therefore I advise you to keep your own
counsel about what doesn’t concern the public.
That’s my view of the matter, at least.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I understand. Then if I openly confess my
apostasy, you dare not have anything to do
with me?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Shaking his head.</i>] I scarcely like to risk it,
Pastor Rosmer. I have made it a rule for some
time past not to support any one or anything that
is actively opposed to the Church.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then you have yourself returned to the Church?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That concerns no one but myself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah, so that is it. Now I understand you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Pastor Rosmer—you ought to remember that I—I
in particular—have not full liberty of action.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What hampers you?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The fact that I am a marked man.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah—indeed.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>A marked man, Pastor Rosmer. You, above all
men, should remember that; for I have chiefly
you to thank for the scandal that branded me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>If I had then stood where I stand now, I should
have dealt more gently with your offence.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That I don’t doubt. But it is too late now. You
have branded me once for all—branded me for
life. I suppose you can scarcely understand what
that means. But now you may perhaps come to
feel the smart of it yourself, Pastor Rosmer.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. You surely don’t suppose that Rector
Kroll and his set will ever forgive a desertion like
yours? I hear the “County News” is going to be
very savage in future. You too may find yourself
a marked man before long.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In personal matters, Mr. Mortensgård, I feel
myself secure from attack. My life is beyond
reproach.</p>

<p class='c001'>[<i>With a sly smile.</i>] That’s a large word, Mr.

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>

  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Your tone is very curious. What are you hinting

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, something definite. Only one thing. But
<em class='gesperrt'>that</em> might be bad enough, if malicious opponents
got wind of it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Will you have the kindness to let me hear what

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Cannot you guess for yourself, Pastor?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, certainly not. I have not the slightest idea.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well well, I suppose I must come out with it
then.—I have in my possession a strange letter,
dated from Rosmersholm.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Miss West’s letter, do you mean? Is it so
strange?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, there’s nothing strange about that. But I
once received another letter from this house.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Also from Miss West?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, Mr. Rosmer.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well then, from whom? From whom?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>From the late Mrs. Rosmer.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>From my wife! You received a letter from my
wife!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I did.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>When?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Towards the close of Mrs. Rosmer’s life. Perhaps
about a year and a half ago. That is the letter I
call strange.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I suppose you know that my wife’s mind was
affected at that time.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; I know many people thought so. But I
don’t think there was anything in the letter to show
it. When I call it strange, I mean in another
sense.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And what in the world did my poor wife take it
into her head to write to <em class='gesperrt'>you</em> about?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have the letter at home. She begins to the
effect that she is living in great anxiety and fear;
there are so many malicious people about here, she
says; and they think of nothing but causing you
trouble and injury.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Me?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, so she says. And then comes the strangest
part of all. Shall I go on, Pastor Rosmer?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Assuredly! Tell me everything, without reserve.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The deceased lady begs and implores me to be
magnanimous. She knows, she says, that it was her
husband that had me dismissed from my post as
teacher; and she conjures me by all that’s sacred
not to avenge myself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How did she suppose you could avenge yourself?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The letter says that if I should hear rumours of
sinful doings at Rosmersholm, I am not to believe
them; they are only spread abroad by wicked
people who wish to make you unhappy.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Is all that in the letter?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You may read it for yourself, sir, when you
please.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But I don’t understand——! What did she
imagine the rumours to be about?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Firstly, that the Pastor had deserted the faith
of his fathers. Your wife denied that absolutely—then.
And next—h’m——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Next?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, next she writes—rather confusedly—that
she knows nothing of any sinful intrigue at
Rosmersholm; that she has never been wronged in
any way. And if any such rumours should get
about, she implores me to say nothing of the
matter in the “Beacon.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Is no name mentioned?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>None.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Who brought you the letter?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have promised not to say. It was handed to
me one evening, at dusk.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>If you had made inquiries at the time, you

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I did make inquiries, Pastor Rosmer. But I
must say that was not the impression I received.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Was it not?—But what is your precise reason
for telling me now about this incomprehensible
old letter?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>To impress on you the necessity for extreme
prudence, Pastor Rosmer.</p>

  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. You must remember that from to-day
you have ceased to be a neutral.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then you have quite made up your mind that
I must have something to conceal?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mortensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I don’t know why an emancipated man should

But, as I said before, be exceedingly cautious in
future. If anything should get abroad that conflicts
with current prejudices, you may be sure
the whole liberal movement will have to suffer

Even while Beata was alive, all my thoughts were
for you. It was you alone I longed for. It was
when you were by my side that I felt the calm

Rebecca—did we not feel for each other from the

<p class='c001'>Yes, look into your own mind, and you will see!
And if this is the case with you, one may easily
guess how it must be with Johannes Rosmer. It
is sheer, unmitigated madness—it is running blindfold
to destruction—for him to think of coming
openly forward and confessing himself an apostate!
Only think—a man of his sensitive nature! Imagine
him disowned and persecuted by the circle
of which he has always formed a part—exposed to
ruthless attacks from all the best people in the
community! He is not—he never can be the man
to endure all that.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Broken me utterly and hopelessly.—I had a

<p class='c001'>Dear, don’t let us talk of that just now.—What

</div>

<p class='c001'>He gathered all our old friends together at his

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, you are lying. You have never believed

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That is not true. You thought that you yourself

<p class='c001'>Listen, Rosmer. Hear what I have to say. It
will be for the last time. [<i>Sits in a chair close to

I was back in the North. But I daresay
it is best that you should hear it at once.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>What you have never suspected. What gives

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It is perfectly true that I once schemed to gain
a footing at Rosmersholm. I thought I could
not fail to turn things to good account here. In
one way or the other—you understand.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, you accomplished your ends.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I believe I could have accomplished anything,
anything in the world—at that time. For I had
still my fearless, free-born will. I knew no scruples—I
stood in awe of no human tie.—But then began
what has broken my will—and cowed me so pitiably
for all my days.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What began? Do not speak in riddles.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It came over me,—this wild, uncontrollable

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>For you.</p>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Tries to spring up.</i>] What is this?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Stops him.</i>] Sit still, dear; there is more to
tell.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And you mean to say—that you have loved me—in
that way!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I thought that it should be called love—then.
Yes, I thought it was love. But it was not. It
was what I said. It was a wild, uncontrollable
passion.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>With difficulty.</i>] Rebecca, is it really you—you
yourself—that you are speaking of?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, would you believe it, Rosmer?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then it was because of this—under the influence
of this—that you—that you “went to
work,” as you call it?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It came upon me like a storm on the sea. It
was like one of the storms we sometimes have in
the North in the winter-time. It seizes you—and
whirls you along with it—wherever it will. There
is no resisting it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And so it swept the unhappy Beata into the mill
race.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; for it was a life-and-death struggle between
Beata and me at that time.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Assuredly you were the strongest at Rosmersholm.
Stronger than Beata and I together.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I judged you rightly in so far that I was sure I
could never reach you until you were a free man,
both in circumstances—and in spirit.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But I don’t understand you, Rebecca. You—yourself—your
whole conduct is an insoluble riddle
to me. I am free now—both in spirit and in circumstances.
You have reached the very goal you
aimed at from the first. And yet——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have never stood farther from my goal than
now.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And yet I say—when I asked you yesterday—begged
you to be my wife—you cried out, as if
in fear, that it could never be.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I cried out in despair, Rosmer.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Because Rosmersholm has sapped my strength.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>My old fearless will has had its wings clipped
here. It is crippled! The time is past when I
had courage for anything in the world. I have
lost the power of action, Rosmer.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Tell me how this has come about.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It has come about through my life with you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But how? How?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>When I was left alone with you here,—and when
you had become yourself again——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, yes?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>——for you were never quite yourself so long
as Beata lived——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I am afraid you are right there.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But when I found myself sharing your life here,—in
quiet—in solitude,—when you showed me
all your thoughts without reserve—every tender
and delicate feeling, just as it came to you—<em class='gesperrt'>then</em>
the great change came over me. Little by
little, you understand. Almost imperceptibly—but
at last with such overwhelming force that it
reached to the depths of my soul.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>All the rest—the horrible sense-intoxicated
desire—passed far, far away from me. All the
whirling passions settled down into quiet and
silence. Rest descended on my soul—a stillness
as on one of our northern bird-cliffs under the
midnight sun.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Tell me more of this. Tell me all you can.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>There is not much more, dear. Only this—it
was love that was born in me. The great self-denying
love, that is content with life, as we two
have lived it together.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It is best as it is. Yesterday—when you asked

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rosmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, did you not, Rebecca! I thought that

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rebecca.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>For a moment, yes. I had forgotten myself.
It was my old buoyant will that was struggling to
be free. But it has no energy left now—no power

  <div class='nf-center'>

<p class='c001'>It is many a long day since I have given a

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, this is precisely what we <em class='gesperrt'>must</em> speak

<p class='c001'>Yes, Rebecca—that is the question that will for
ever haunt me—when you are gone. Every hour
in the day it will return upon me. Oh, I seem to
see you before my very eyes. You are standing
out on the foot-bridge—right in the middle.
Now you are bending forward over the railing—drawn
dizzily downwards, downwards towards the
rushing water! No—you recoil. You have not
the heart to do what <em class='gesperrt'>she</em> dared.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I should have to believe you then. I should

<p class='c001'>Then I have no time to lose, Mrs. Wangel. Remember—I

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well then, all the more reason to make haste.
[<i>Is silent for a moment, then says earnestly and in

am going to tell you something I could not

  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>When you took—that unsuccessful step, as you

than I did.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>I know that. You had nothing but friendship

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But you do not know that my whole mind and

  </div>

<p class='c001'>Not Wangel? But at that time—out at Skioldvik—I

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, no,—I daresay not. For the whole thing

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, it is enough for you to know that I was

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How can I tell? When Wangel came, my

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I told him from the first that my thoughts had
once been drawn elsewhere. He has never wanted
to know more. We have never touched upon the
subject since. After all, it was nothing but a
piece of madness; and then it all came to an end
so quickly. At least,—in a way.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh yes, of course! My dear good Arnholm, it
is not at all as you suppose. It’s something quite
incomprehensible. I don’t think I could find
words to tell you of it. You would only think I
was ill—or else that I was stark mad.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; you see I have a patron in Bergen who

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, it was a great stroke of luck. I once went
a voyage in one of his ships.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Did you? Then at that time you wanted to be
a sailor?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, not in the least. But after my mother
died, my father wouldn’t have me hanging about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>at home; so he sent me to sea. On the voyage
home, we were wrecked in the English Channel;
and that was a grand thing for me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It was in the wreck that I got my lesion—this
weakness in my chest, you know. I was in the
ice-cold water so long before they came and
rescued me. So then I had to give up the sea—Oh
yes, it was a great stroke of luck.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; for the lesion is nothing to speak of; and
now I am to have my heart’s desire, and to be a
sculptor. Only think—to be able to model in the
delicate clay that yields so exquisitely under your
fingers!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And what are you going to model? Mermen

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, nothing of that kind. As soon as I can
manage it, I mean to have a try at a big piece of
work—a group, as they call it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, I thought of something out of my own experience.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes yes,—by all means stick to that.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, I had thought of a young woman, a sailor’s
wife, lying and sleeping in a strange unrest, and
dreaming as she sleeps. I think I can make it so
that any one can see she is dreaming.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No. There is to be one other figure—a kind of
shape you might call it. It is the husband she
has been unfaithful to while he was away. And
now he is drowned.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, he is drowned at sea. But the strange
thing is that he has come home nevertheless. It’s
in the night-time; and there he stands by her

wet, just as when they haul you up out of the sea.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, you see, when we were starting for home
in the brig, from a town they call Halifax, we had
to leave our boatswain behind us in the hospital;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>so we shipped an American in his place. This
new boatswain——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The American?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes;—one day he borrowed from the captain a
bundle of old newspapers, and was perpetually
poring over them, he wanted to learn Norwegian,
he said.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well; and then?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, one evening it was blowing great guns.
All hands were on deck—all except the boatswain
and me. For he had sprained his ankle and
couldn’t walk; and I wasn’t very well, and was
lying in my bunk. Well, there he sat in the
fo’c’sle, reading away as usual at one of the old
papers——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well? well?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>When all of a sudden, I heard him give a kind
of a roar; and when I looked at him I saw that
his face was as white as chalk. Then he set to
work to crumple and crush the paper up, and
tear it into a thousand little pieces; but that
he did quietly, quietly.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Did he say nothing at all? Did he not speak?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not at first. But presently he said, as if to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>himself: “Married—to another man—while I
was away.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Shuts her eyes, and says half to herself</i>:] Did he
say that?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; and would you believe it—he said it in
perfectly good Norwegian. He must have had a
great gift for languages, that man.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And what then? What happened next?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Now comes the wonderful part of it—a thing I
shall never forget to my dying day. For he added,—and
this quite quietly too: “But mine she is,
and mine she shall remain. And follow me she
shall, though I should have to go home and fetch
her, as a drowned man from the bottom of the
sea.”</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And he said it with such force of will that I
felt he was the man to do it too.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh he’s dead, Mrs. Wangel, beyond a doubt.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>We were shipwrecked afterwards in the Channel,
you know. I got off in the long-boat with the
captain and five others; but the mate went in the
dingey, and with him was the American and one
man besides.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, not a word, Mrs. Wangel. My patron wrote
me so, only the other day. And that is the very
reason I am so anxious to make a group of it. I
can see the sailor’s faithless wife so life-like before
me; and then the avenger, who is drowned, but
nevertheless comes home from sea. I have them
both before my eyes as distinctly as possible.</p>

<p class='c001'>About you; and about our relation to each

  </div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The suspicion has often crossed my mind; but
to-day I saw it clearly. The children’s little commemoration—you
looked on me as a sort of
accomplice.—Well yes; a man’s memories are not
to be wiped out—not mine, at all events. It is
not in my nature.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

</div>

<p class='c001'>But you are mistaken, none the less. It seems
to you almost as though the children’s mother
were still alive. You feel her invisible presence
in our midst. You think that my heart is equally
divided between you and her. It is this idea that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>revolts you. You see, as it were, something
immoral in our relation; and that is why you
cannot, or will not, live with me any more as my
wife.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, to-day I have at last seen through it—into

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Into the very depths, you say. Oh, you mustn’t

  </div>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. There is this: that you cannot endure
your surroundings here. The mountains oppress
you and weigh upon your spirits. There is not
light enough for you here—the horizon is not
wide enough—the air not strong and stimulating
enough for you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, yes; I do not doubt it, dear. That is not
why I speak of it now. I only want to remind
you that I, on my side, was frank with you. I
told you quite openly that I had once in my life
cared for some one else. That it had come to—a
sort of betrothal between us.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, something of the kind. Well, it lasted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>only a very short time. He went away; and
afterwards I broke it off. All this I told you.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But, dear Ellida, why go back upon all this?

  <div class='nf-center'>

<p class='c001'>He called himself Friman<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> then. Afterwards,

<p class='c001'>From Finmark, he said. He was born over in

<p class='c001'>Mainly about the sea.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>About storm and calm. About dark nights at
sea. About the sea in the glittering sunshine,
too. But we talked most about the whales, and
the porpoises, and the seals that lie out upon the
reefs and bask in the midday sun. And then we
spoke of the gulls and the eagles, and all the
other sea-birds, you know. And—is it not
strange?—when we talked of such things, it
seemed to me as though both the sea-animals and
the sea-birds were akin to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes; he said I was to do it.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, not very often. He went over the lighthouse
one day; that is how I came to know him.
And afterwards we used to meet occasionally.
But then came this affair about the captain; and
he had to go away.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>

    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It was in the dusk of the early morning that I
got a line from him. It said that I must come
out to him at Bratthammer<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a>—you know, the

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. I could not help it. Well—he told me
that he had stabbed the captain in the night.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>He would not tell me the reason. He said it
was not a thing for me to hear about.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I never thought of doubting him. Well, at
all events he had to go away. But when he was
on the point of saying good-bye to me——No,
you could never imagine what he did.</p>

<p class='c001'>He took a key-ring out of his pocket, and drew
off his finger a ring he used to wear. Then he took
from me a little ring that I had, and these two he
slipped together on the key-ring. And then he
said that now we two should together be wedded
to the sea.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I heard from him. First, I got a line or
two from Archangel. He said nothing but that
he was going over to America; and he told me
where to address an answer.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Immediately. I said, of course, that all must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>over between us—that he must never think of me
again, as I meant never to think any more of him.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, he wrote again.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>And what was his answer to what you had said?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not a word. He wrote just as if I had never
broken with him. He told me quite calmly that
I must wait for him. When he was ready for me
he would let me know, and then I was to come to
him at once.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>

    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No. So I wrote again, almost word for word the

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh no, far from it. He wrote as calmly as before.
Never a word about my having broken with him.
Then I saw it was useless, so I wrote to him no
more.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I have had three letters from him since.
Once he wrote from California and once from
China. The last letter I got from him was from
Australia. He said he was going to the goldmines;
and since then I have heard nothing from

<p class='c001'>[<i>Without answering.</i>] He came to know, during

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I read all the useful books I can get hold
of. One wants to know a little about the world.
Here we live so entirely outside of everything,—or
almost entirely.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, my dear Boletta, don’t say that.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But I do say so. I don’t see much difference
between our life and the life of the carp in the
pond there. They have the fiord close beside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>them, where the great free shoals of fish sweep
out and in. But the poor tame house-fishes know
nothing of all that; and they can never join in.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I don’t think it would agree with them at all
if they did get out into the fiord.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, they might take their chance of <em class='gesperrt'>that</em>, I
should think.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Besides, you can’t say that you are so utterly
out of the world here. Not in summer, at all
events. This place is a sort of local centre,
nowadays, in the life of the world—a point of
convergence for many passing streams.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Smiling</i>.] Oh, you are in the passing stream
yourself; it is easy for you to make game of us.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I make game——? What puts that into your
head?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, all this about a centre, and a point of convergence
for the life of the world, is simply what
you have heard people say in the town. They
are always talking like that.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, frankly, I have noticed as much.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But there’s really not a word of truth in it, you
know—not for us who live here constantly. What
is it to us that the great outside world passes our
doors on its way to the midnight sun? We cannot
join in the stream. There is no midnight sun
for <em class='gesperrt'>us</em>. Oh no; we must be content to linger our
lives out, here in our carp-pond.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Seats himself besides her.</i>] Tell me now, dear
Boletta—I wonder if there is not something or
other,—some particular thing I mean—that you
are all the time longing for, here at home?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, perhaps there may be.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then what is it? What are you longing for?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Chiefly to get away.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That before everything?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. And next to learn a little more; to gain
some real insight into things in general.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>When I used to read with you, your father often
said that he would let you go to college.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh yes, poor father,—he says so many things.
But when it comes to the point, then——. There
is no real energy in father.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, unfortunately—I suppose there is not. But
have you ever talked to him about this? Put
serious pressure on him, I mean?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, I can’t say that I have.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well now really, Boletta, you ought to do so,
before it is too late. Why don’t you?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, because there is no real energy in me either,
I suppose. I probably take after father in that.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>H’m—I wonder whether you don’t do yourself
injustice there?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh no, I’m sorry to say. And then father has
so little time to think about me and my future—and
not much inclination either. He puts things
of that sort aside as much as he can; he is so
entirely taken up with Ellida——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>With whom——? How——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I mean that he and my stepmother——[<i>Breaking
off.</i>] Father and mother lead a life of their
own, you see.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, so much the more reason for you to see
about getting away.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, but at the same time I don’t feel as if I
had the right to go away—to leave father.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But, my dear Boletta, you will have to leave
him some time, in any case; and since that is so,
why delay——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I suppose there is nothing else for it. Of
course I ought to think of myself too, and try to
find a position of some sort. When once father is
gone I shall have no one to depend on.—But poor
father,—I dread the thought of leaving him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Dread——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, for his own sake.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But, bless me, what about your stepmother?
She will still be with him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that’s true. But she is not at all fitted for
all that mother knew so well how to do. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>are so many things she doesn’t see—or perhaps
<em class='gesperrt'>will</em> not see—or trouble herself about. I don’t
know which way to put it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>H’m,—I think I understand what you mean?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Poor father,—he is weak in certain ways. I
daresay you have noticed that yourself. You see
he hasn’t enough work to fill up his whole time;
and then she is quite incapable of being any support
to him.—That is partly his own fault, however.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How so?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, father always likes to see cheerful faces
around him; there must be sunshine and contentment
in the house, he says. So I am afraid he
often lets her have medicine that does her no good
in the long run.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Do you really think so?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I can’t get rid of the idea. She is so
strange at times. [<i>Vehemently.</i>] But it does seem
hard, does it not, that I should have to stay on at
home here? It does not in reality help father at
all; and I can’t but feel that I have duties towards
myself too.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I’ll tell you what, my dear Boletta,—we must
talk all this over more thoroughly.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, that won’t help much; I daresay I was
created to pass my life here in the carp-pond.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not at all. It depends entirely upon yourself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Eagerly.</i>] Do you think so?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, believe me; it lies wholly and solely in
your own hands.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, if it only did——! Do you mean that you
will put in a good word for me with father?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I will do that too. But first of all I want to
speak frankly and without reserve to you yourself,
my dear Boletta. [<i>Looks out to the left.</i>] Hush!
Let no one notice anything; we’ll finish our talk
by-and-by.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>No, I don’t believe it. I believe that if men

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, at any rate, it is a theory of mine. I have

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Joking.</i>] Well, who knows? But what’s done
is done. We have once for all taken the wrong
turning and become land animals instead of sea
animals. All things considered, I’m afraid it is
too late now to rectify the error.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that is the mournful truth. And I believe
people have an instinctive feeling of it themselves—it
haunts them like a secret sorrow and regret.
Believe me, this lies at the very root of the
melancholy of mankind. I am sure it does.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But my dear Mrs. Wangel,—I have never
noticed that people are so profoundly melancholy.
I should say, on the contrary, that most people
take life cheerfully and lightly—with a great, calm,
unconscious joy.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ellida.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh no, that is not so. That joy—it is just like
our joy in the long, light summer days. It has in
it the foreboding of the darkness to come. And
this foreboding casts its shadow over the joy of
mankind,—just as the driving scud casts its
shadow over the fiord. There it lies all blue and
shining; and then all of a sudden——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Indeed; have you?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. I very often think about things of that
sort; and particularly about marriage. And then
I have read a good deal on the subject too. I
think marriage may be counted a sort of miracle:
the woman is transformed, as it were, by degrees,
and comes to resemble her husband.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that’s just it!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

wouldn’t——</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then do you think that what a man has mastered
by reading—or by his own thought—can be passed
on in this way to his wife?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that too; by degrees; as if by a miracle.
But of course I know that this could only happen
in a marriage that is faithful, and loving, and really
happy.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Has it never occurred to you that perhaps a

his wife? Might come to resemble her, I mean.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No; a man has his vocation to live for, you
know. And that is what makes a man so strong
and resolute, Miss Wangel. He has his life-work.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh no. I was thinking mainly of artists.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Do you think it right for an artist to marry?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Most certainly; if he can find some one he really
loves——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Even then it seems to me that he should rather
live for his art alone.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course he must; but he can quite well do
that even if he marries.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>

for?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>She too must live for his art. I should think
that must be such happiness for a woman.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh yes, Miss Wangel, believe me. It is not
only all the honour and glory she enjoys through
him; that, I should say, is almost the least part
of it. But that she can help him to create,—that
she can lighten his labour by being ever at his
side, and tending him, and making life thoroughly
comfortable for him. It seems to me that must
be such a delight for a woman.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, no doubt you are right. But, bless my

<p class='c001'>No. And besides, I cannot expect her to interfere

[<i>Breaking off.</i>] But that was not what we were

any more thought to it?—to all that I told you
last night?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>

<p class='c001'>My dear Doctor, I think that you, as a physician,
ought to know better than I.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, if you only knew how difficult it is for a
physician to form a valid judgment in the case of
a patient he loves so dearly! And this is no
common disorder either—no case for an ordinary
physician, or for ordinary remedies.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have just been up to see her, and she appeared
to me quite calm. But behind all her moods
something seems to be hidden that eludes me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>entirely. And then she is so variable—so incalculable—so
subject to sudden changes.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No doubt that is due to her morbid state of
mind.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not entirely. The germ of it all is innate in
her. Ellida belongs to the sea-folk; that is the
trouble.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What do you mean precisely, my dear Doctor?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Have you not noticed that the people who live
out by the open sea are like a race apart? They
seem almost to live the life of the sea itself.
There is the surge of the sea—and its ebb and
flow too—both in their thoughts and in their
feelings. And they never bear transplantation.
No, I should have thought of <em class='gesperrt'>that</em> before. It was
a positive sin against Ellida to take her away from
the sea and bring her in here!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, more and more; but I ought to have
known it from the first. Oh, I did really know it
then too, but I would not acknowledge it to myself.
I loved her so much, you see! And consequently
I thought first of myself. In fact, I was
utterly and unpardonably selfish.</p>

<p class='c001'>H’m,—I am afraid every man is a trifle selfish

I have noticed that vice in you, Dr. Wangel.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Wandering uneasily up and down.</i>] Oh yes!
And I have been so since, as well. I am so much,
much older than she; I ought to have been to
her like a father and a guide in one. I ought, to
have done my best to develop and clarify her intelligence.
But unfortunately I have done nothing
of the sort. I have not had energy enough, you
see! And in fact I preferred to have her just as
she was. But then she grew worse and worse,
and I was at my wits’ end to know what to do
[<i>Lower.</i>] That is why I turned to you in my perplexity,
and asked you to come to us.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, of course you do not; I had got upon a
wrong scent. I fancied that Ellida had once
cared for you, and that she still had a secret leaning
in your direction. So I thought it might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>perhaps do her good to see you again, and have a
talk with you about home and old times.</p>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Evasively.</i>] H’m—upon my soul I don’t know
what to say. It was not quite light when I saw
him; and besides, Ellida had talked so much
about this likeness beforehand—I don’t think it
was possible for me to observe him without any
bias.</p>

<p class='c001'>No, no; very likely not. But then the other
point: that all this dread and unrest came upon
her just at the very time when this stranger would
seem to have been on his way home?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well you see—that again is a belief she must
have imagined and dreamt herself into, since
the day before yesterday. It did not come upon
her at all so suddenly—so instantaneously—as she
now maintains. But since she heard from this
young Lyngstrand that Johnston or Friman—or
whatever he is called—was on his way home three
years ago—in March—she has evidently persuaded
herself that her mental trouble came on in the
very same month.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not at all. There had been unmistakable
symptoms of it long before that.—It is true she
happened—by chance—to have a rather severe
attack precisely in the month of March, three
years ago——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, but that is quite easily accounted for by the

in at that time.</p>

<p class='c001'>What if you made up your mind to a change of

    <div><span class='sc'>Wangel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My dear fellow, do you think I haven’t suggested
<em class='gesperrt'>that</em> to her? I proposed that we should
move out to Skioldvik. But she will not.</p>

<p class='c001'>No. She thinks it would be useless; and I daresay

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; and besides—on considering the matter
more closely—I really don’t see how I could
manage it. I scarcely think I should be justified,
on the girls’ account, in moving to such an out-of-the-way
corner. After all, they must live where
there is at least <em class='gesperrt'>some</em> chance of their one day
being able to marry.</p>

you nor any one else. You can forbid me to go
away with him—to cast in my lot with him—if I
should choose that. You can forcibly detain me
here, against my will. That you can do. But the
choice in my innermost soul—my choice of him
and not of you,—in case I should and must choose
so,—that you cannot prevent.</p>

hearts, I mean. They have never been
mine.—When I go away—if I do go away—either
with him to-night or out to Skioldvik to-morrow,—I
have not a key to give up, not a direction to
leave behind me, about anything in the world.
You see how utterly without root I am in your
house; how I have stood entirely outside of
everything from the very first moment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oh yes, Wangel, I know that so well! But now
all this must be paid for; it will have its revenge.
There is nothing here now that has any binding
power over me—nothing to support—nothing to
help me. There is no counter-fascination for me
in what should have been the dearest treasure of
our common life.</p>

to offer me—for the last and only time—a

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well—your father you will have to leave sooner

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Now you must listen to me a little, Boletta.

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, how could such an offer—from you,—how

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No doubt you are right. You did not know,

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Did you come here for—for my sake?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I did, Boletta. I got a letter from your
father this spring—and in it was a phrase which
led me to believe—h’m—that you had kept your
former tutor in—in a little more than friendly
remembrance.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How could father say such a thing?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It appears that was not what he meant at all.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>But in the meantime I had accustomed myself to
the thought that here was a young girl waiting
and longing for me to come again.—No, you
mustn’t interrupt me, dear Boletta! And, you
see,—when a man, like myself, is no longer in the
first flush of youth, such a belief—or illusion—makes
an exceedingly strong impression. A
vivid—a grateful affection for you grew up within
me. I felt I must come to you; see you again;
tell you that I shared the feelings which I
imagined you entertained for me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But now, when you know that it was not so!
That it was a mistake!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That makes no difference, Boletta. Your
image—as it dwells in my heart—will always
remain coloured and thrown into relief by the
feeling that mistake aroused in me. Perhaps you
cannot understand this; but so it is.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>

  </div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, it seems so utterly impossible, Mr. Arnholm.

    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course I stand to my proposition, none the
less. I will take care that you get away from
home and see something of the world. I will
enable you to learn what you really want to, and
live in security and independence. Your more
distant future, too, I will provide for, Boletta. In
me you will always have a firm, steadfast friend to
rely upon. Be sure of that!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Arnholm.</span></div>

    <div><span class='sc'>Boletta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, surely you can see it is! After what you
have said to me—and after the answer I have

    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, I scarcely think that would do. You see,
marriage is out of the question for me for a few

she will be a bit too old for me, I fancy.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; for it would help me so much; as an

it is kind of her, all the same.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hilda.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Do you think, then, that you can get on quicker

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I imagine so. You see, the knowledge
that somewhere in the world a young, exquisite,
silent woman is secretly dreaming of one—I think
it must be so—so——. Well, I scarcely know
what to call it.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Thrilling? Oh yes. It is thrilling I mean; or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>something of that sort. [<i>Looks at her a moment.</i>]
You are so bright, Miss Hilda; really you are very
bright, you know. When I come home again you
will be just about as old as your sister is now.
Perhaps you will look as she looks now; and perhaps
you will have grown like her in mind as well.
Very likely you will be, as it were, both yourself
and her—in one body, so to speak.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, all in black. Do you think I should look
nice?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Black is scarcely the thing for the summer-time.
But for that matter I am sure you would look
extremely well in black too. Yes, you have just
the figure for it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hilda.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Gazing before her.</i>] In black right up to the

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lyngstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>If you were dressed like that, Miss Hilda, I
should long to be a painter—so that I might paint

<p class='c001'>There are quite a few instances of missing punctuation. The
conventional period following the character’s name is sometimes
missing and has been added for consistency’s sake without
further comment. Those missing from setting and stage direction
are also added without comment, since there is no obvious purpose to be
served by the omission. However, the restoration of punctuation
missing from dialogue is noted below, since the punctuation is
frequently expressive. Several instances of dubious ‘?’ marks have
been corrected, based on context.</p>

<p class='c001'>As noted below, on p. <a href='#Page_62'>62</a>, there is apparently a missing word in the
phrase ‘And even&nbsp;&nbsp;it were so...’, most likely ‘if’.</p>

<p class='c001'>Volume I of this series included errata for each succeeding volume,
and noted the following for Volume IX. Each of these was corrected
in printing.</p>

<p class='c001'>The words ‘stepmother’ and ‘footpath’ both appear hyphenated once, midline.
Both have been retained.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
